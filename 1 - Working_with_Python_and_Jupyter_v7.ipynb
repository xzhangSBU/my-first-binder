For example, we might go online and run a BLAST search to identify a protein sequence. The default BLAST parameters are designed to limit the amount of data we receive to 100 sequences. In many cases this is more than sufficient, and we can stay out of \"Big Data\" weeds so to speak. \n\nHowever, protein (and nucleotide) sequences are rich with information, and there is much knowledge to be gained about evolutionary relationships between proteins using Big Data. Processing large datasets often requires specialized software packages. \n\nThe overarching goals of this exercise are to:\n\n    1. Learn to navigate Jupyter Lab and Notebooks in the Binder.org environment\n    2. Learn about FASTA sequence files\n    3. Be able to handle, filter, and clean large sequence datasets\n    4. Learn about and use the basic local alignment sequence tool (BLAST)\n    5. Be able to create interactive sequence similarity networks from BLAST results to investigate sequence relationships\n    6.

There are many benefits of using a Jupyter notebook in your classroom or lab, including access to a variety of Big Data programming tools (code sections) and the ability to include narrative sections (such as this one, also called a markdown section). \n\nYou can edit markdown sections. Just double click in the markdown area and type what you like. Go ahead and double click in this box.\n\nTo return to the formatted view, you need to \"run\" the markdown section. With the box highlighted (the vertical blue bar at left), you can run the code in two ways. The first way is to click the Run (Play) button near the top of the page. The second way is to use shift+return.\n\nHere is a link to some cool formatting you can do in markdown sections https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-and-markdown-cbc1f0ea6406, but you can also do an internet search for \"jupyter markdown.\" \n***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook is based on the Python 3 programming language.

We also want to utilize NCBI BLAST software to use expectation values for visualization, the CD-HIT software to reduce our data set size in a rational way, and cytoscape for viewing networks!\n\nWhile it is possible to install most of this software on any computer, it can be very difficult to get everything working. Also, many of us want to do or teach the science, so figuring out how to install all the software is not a good use of our time.  \n\nWe are running this Jupter notebook in Binder, a <i> remote </i> environment that I have set up. In this environment all the needed software is already installed, and we can easily upload files to work with! Check out more at https://mybinder.org.\n***\n\n## Some important ideas for using Jupyter Notebooks in Binder\n\n    1. Please ensure the code in a cell has finished running before moving on to the next one!\n    2. If you accidentally delete or mangle some code, use the Edit -> Undo function!\n    3. If you need to stop some code from running in a cell use the Stop button (next to the Run button).\n    4. If you don't interact with Binder for too long, you may lose the Kernel and need to restart it. \n    5. If you are away for a long time, then you may need to relaunch your Binder - which means you might need to regenerate any data that you did not download!\n***\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Investigating evolutionary relationships through sequence and cluster analysis!\n# On to the Science - Importing some sequence data!\n\nIn this set of Jupyter Notebooks you will guide you through obtaining a set of DtxR-related protein sequences and working with and processing those sequences to create a sequence similarity network (SSN).
